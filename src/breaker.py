"""Circuit breaker for cross-session scopes.

The 50x-$9,999 pattern (PRIMER.md 1.4) is already closed by
aggregates.cumulative_cost: DENYs don't count, so retrying the *same*
amount keeps failing once the running total is over budget. This solves a
different problem - an agent (or attacker) that doesn't retry the same
amount, but *searches* for one that slips under: try $9,999, get denied,
try $500, try $50, try $1... Cumulative cost alone can't see that pattern,
because each smaller request might individually still fit.

The rule this file implements instead: once a scope has been denied, it's
done - every further request for that scope auto-DENYs, and Cedar isn't
even asked - until a human appends an explicit override (see
ledger.insert_override). authorize.py should call is_tripped() before its
existing cumulative_cost check, so a tripped scope never even gets that
far.
